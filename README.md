# Rust style team repository

This is the home of the [Rust style team](https://www.rust-lang.org/governance/teams/lang#Style%20team). The style team is responsible for
determining the default Rust style, including styling for new language
constructs, as well as evolving the Rust style over time.

The [Rust style
guide](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/HEAD/src/doc/style-guide/src)
lives in the `rust-lang/rust` repository. In particular, see the [guiding
principles](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/HEAD/src/doc/style-guide/src/principles.md)
of the Rust style.

This repository includes:
- The [charter](charter.md) for the style team.
- The [policy](team-policy.md) for the style team, including the [handling of
  style for nightly language constructs](nightly-style-procedure.md).
